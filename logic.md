we are gonna create budget app.

//*************** logic ****************

/*
1. selected all the elements and stored in variable.

2. ----------*********** creating nessecory variables ********----------
let ENTRY_LIST = []; <-  whenver user write input whether it is expnense or income i am going to push that in this array.

-------------------------------------------------

let balance = 0;
let income = 0;
let outcome = 0 <- these three holds the initial value;

instead of creating three variable seprately we can use array destcturing

let [balance, income, outcome] = [0, 0, 0];

let [deletBtn, editBtn] = ['fas-fa-trash', 'far-fa-edit'] <- i am gonna add these icon dynamically. that is why stored in variable.
